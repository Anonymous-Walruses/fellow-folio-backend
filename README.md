# FellowFolio Backend

Rust (Rocket) backend for FellowFolio

## Running:

### Prerequesites:
- `build-essentials` (Linux)
- Microsoft Visual Studio Build tools (Windows)
- Not sure about Mac, but probably same as Linux

Run `make run-debug` to build and run the development build, or `make run` to
build and run the production build. The server should now be accessible on
`localhost:8000`.
